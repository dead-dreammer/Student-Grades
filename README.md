 The user inputs the number of students and then provides each student's name, surname, test scores, assignment score, and exam score. The program validates that all scores are within the range 0 to 100.

The program computes:

The period mark, which is 33% from Test 1, 33% from Test 2, and 34% from the assignment.
The final mark, which is 40% from the period mark and 60% from the exam.
Whether the student passed or failed (students pass if their period mark is ≥40 and their final mark is ≥50).
Finally, the program displays a formatted table with each student’s name, surname, period mark, final mark, and pass/fail status.
